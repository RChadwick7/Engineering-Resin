Stiffness:

the Impact resistance partly comes from the Resins ability to conform to impacts aka beeing a bit flexible, if you want stiffer pieces, you can increase thickness,
add stiffener ribs in your 3d modell or mix the Resin with a more rigid type of Resin. the bigger the Part of Engineering Resin , the better the impact resistance.
Opaque colored Resins also often have stiffer characteristics than clear Resins.

Underwater:

Engineering Resin is not intended to be used under water,
but we had great results with a mixture of 50% Engineering Resin and 50% Standard Resin for Underwater Applications.


strengthening Flexible Resins:

If your usual Flexible Resin results in parts that Rip easily in use, consider mixing 25% Engineering Resin to it.
this mixture makes it just a little bit less flexible but drastically increases durability.


Coloring:
We tried out a few brands of colorants, and our official recommendation is:
3DBasics Color Ampule
This specific colorant gave us the best repeatability and even coloring, as well as easy dosage.
