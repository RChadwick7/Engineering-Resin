Stiffness:
the Impact resistance partly comes from the Resins ability to vonform to impacts aka beeing a bit flexible, if you want stiffer pieces, you ca nincrease thickness,
add stiffener ribs in your 3d modell or mix the Resin with a more rigid type of Resin. the bigger the Aprt of Engineering Resin , the better the impact resistance.
Opaque colored Resins also often have stiffer characteristics than clear Resins.

Underwater:

Engineering Resin is not intended to be used under water,
but we had great results with a mixture of 50% Engineering Resin and 50% Standard Resin for Underwater Applications.


strengthening Flexible Resins:
If your usual Flexible Resin results in parts that Rip easily in use, condisder mixing 25% Engineering Resin to it.
this mixture makes it just a little bit less flexible but drasticalyl increases durability.
