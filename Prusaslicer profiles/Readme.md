I could not figure out how to export a single material prfile form Prusaslicer wihtout printer settings and so on. So please take alook at the screenshot and paste in the values.
This Profile is untested, as I currently don have a SL1 to test them on.
Please share your findings if you found good values for your machine.
thanks CLem
